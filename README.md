# Whasapp-Data-Analysis
The sudden outburst of the Internet has made it easier for people to communicate with people across the world. Social media provides humongous data to carry out various algorithms and predict the output. WhatApp is considered to be the most popular application due to its huge customer base. In this project, we have performed the text and opinion mining on WhatsApp chat data to understand the people in a better way. We chose WhatsApp data due to its number of users and way of retrieving data. Our project will deliver the graphical visualizations for Text analysis and sentimental analysis which include message count, emojis, frequency of the texts and emojis, lexical diversity, word cloud and sentiment score. We believe that the results of this project could help the Government, companies and Organizations to gain better insights about the people. This analysis might also help to avoid conflicts that might arise due to emotional mismatch or misunderstanding.
