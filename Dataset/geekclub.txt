2019-05-07, 1:13 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: No no, Mountain should only be killed by one person.
2019-05-07, 1:13 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: And that is Hound.

Mountain will be killed by the hound
2019-05-07, 1:21 a.m. - +91 84859 18837: Jon will be destroyed i think in next episode itself
2019-05-07, 1:21 a.m. - +91 84859 18837: 😕😕
2019-05-07, 1:21 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: Well that would make fans hate the show.
2019-05-07, 1:21 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: They won't kill him till the last episode. Till the last minute.
2019-05-07, 1:22 a.m. - +91 84859 18837: That's the plan,, bt let's see😕😅
2019-05-07, 1:22 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: It will effect the viewership.
2019-05-07, 1:22 a.m. - Sanket: I don't think jon is gonna be killed by anyone,
2019-05-07, 1:22 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: And fans are already angry with episode 3.
2019-05-07, 1:22 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: Hope they don't ruin the ending. It should be satisfying.
2019-05-07, 1:22 a.m. - Sanket: He will live,
Otherwise there was no purpose of him coming back from death,
2019-05-07, 1:23 a.m. - +91 84859 18837: Dnt kw why😕
I mean it's quick end,,  but still it had to be end..
2019-05-07, 1:23 a.m. - Sanket: The word is "a bit dissatisfied"
2019-05-07, 1:23 a.m. - Sanket: U maybe angry,
I m not, at all,
I thought it could be better, but in the end, it was glorious
2019-05-07, 1:24 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: Most of the fans are "angry"
2019-05-07, 1:24 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: 😅

2019-05-07, 1:25 a.m. - Sanket: It was always going to be controversial, 
It had to end some way,
And it did,
2019-05-07, 1:26 a.m. - +91 84859 18837: I think problem is that,, they have shown us that night king is like beyond every tricks,, no one could kill him,, so only no one could kill him..  But the way no one killed him is bit unusual as standards of Got..
2019-05-07, 1:27 a.m. - Sanket: It was alright,
People who think they r being critics are just overreacting
2019-05-07, 1:27 a.m. - Sanket: Critics who are condemning the end are okay with people rising from the dead, dragons breathing fire, even arya changing faces, comes automatically in shape of that person, and they take objection with that ending scene, after thinking a bit, it makes me laugh !!
😂
2019-05-07, 1:27 a.m. - +91 84859 18837: Even dragon fire kai ukhadi na sakyu nk  nu so, Simple attack in just 10 seconds is way to easy for him to be dead

😅
2019-05-07, 1:30 a.m. - +91 84859 18837: We're okay with all that, and that's why we need something more.. 😅
2019-05-07, 1:36 a.m. - Sanket: He was stabbed in same place at which he was stabbed to be created as NK by children of forest in the first place by exact similar material
2019-05-07, 1:36 a.m. - Sanket: But why rhaegal...

2019-05-08, 1:40 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: It's just a fan theory.
2019-05-08, 1:40 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: Wouldn't make sense to introduce a new dragon at like the end of the final season.

2019-05-08, 1:42 p.m. - Sanket: Yeh

2019-05-08, 2:17 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: And now I have a website. And I'm running short of ideas to put on the blog.
2019-05-08, 2:18 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: Coming to the question, what if I did Game Of Thrones episode reviews? Or movie reviews?
2019-05-08, 2:24 p.m. - Rohan: Try movie reviews 
GOT is about to over now
2019-05-08, 3:21 p.m. - Sanket: GOT reviews would be good now,
But whoever reviews, i wouldn't usually like to see unnecessarily negative or discouraging reviews, it should be arguable off course, but in the end, good things should be covered too from a particular episode or a movie,
2019-05-08, 3:21 p.m. - Sanket: Overall it's supposed to be neutral

2019-05-10, 8:14 a.m. - Sanket: It happens when u read so much unnecessary things,
2019-05-10, 8:14 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: You don't have to take it seriously🙄
2019-05-10, 8:14 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: I feel the same way about episode 3 and 4.
2019-05-10, 8:14 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: Not because I read it online.
2019-05-10, 8:15 a.m. - Sanket: When something gets so famous, people never stop trying give their shit opinions which make us question about that too,
Otherwise this season has been quite alright for me
2019-05-10, 8:15 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: But I'm talking about my opinion. Everyone gets to have a opinion. Free speech and what not.
2019-05-10, 8:16 a.m. - Sanket: Yeh sure,
2019-05-10, 8:16 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: It shouldn't make you question anything if you already like it.
2019-05-10, 8:16 a.m. - Akshay Shah: I think, you all guys should send your favorite fan theory, and then we will see, whose theory is quite nearer.
2019-05-10, 8:17 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: Well, I agree.
But it's not a fan theory.😅

2019-05-10, 8:17 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: Which would be?🤔
2019-05-10, 8:17 a.m. - Rohan: Iron throne
2019-05-10, 8:19 a.m. - Sanket: My opinions is, "this season hasn't been traditionally GOTlike, u know slow story telling type, but it doesn't always have to be like that, action wise and from emotional point of view, it has been fascinating,
2019-05-10, 8:19 a.m. - Sanket: opinion*
2019-05-10, 8:20 a.m. - Sanket: <Media omitted>
2019-05-10, 8:20 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: But action isn't everything.
What we've come to expect from Game of thrones over the years is fantastic story telling.
2019-05-10, 8:20 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: I don't mind it slow.
2019-05-10, 8:21 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: But then they Are the ones who will hastily cramp everything together into the finale.
2019-05-10, 8:23 a.m. - Sanket: It's an endgame now, 
This is wartime, still there have been many memorable conversations, but they 've to now squish things relatively speaking, action matters in these circumstances
2019-05-10, 8:24 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: Well

2019-05-11, 6:40 a.m. - Sanket: I don't wanna say anything, sharing it again,
Statements based on just god knows what, maybe too much social media or online reading by some random critics constantly could harm the brain!
2019-05-11, 6:40 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: Um, bro. Why are you blaming them.
2019-05-11, 6:41 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: This is my opinion.

2019-05-11, 6:41 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: I hate a character, it's my choice.
2019-05-11, 6:42 a.m. - Sanket: This has become a fashion recently to say some things on internet, one of the things is calling dany "a mad queen"

2019-05-11, 6:46 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: 🤦🏻‍♂ I don't call Dany a mad queen bcoz she didn't do anything
2019-05-11, 6:46 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: I call her that bcoz she is so lust full for the throne like cersei
2019-05-11, 6:46 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: That she is becoming a cersei
2019-05-11, 6:46 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: Didn't even let her soldiers rest

😟
2019-05-14, 12:30 a.m. - +91 84859 18837: Nd now she's that mad she's type of hateful for all..
2019-05-14, 12:31 a.m. - +91 84859 18837: Yea..  Even lill disappointed with cersi's death, i mean both queen should have to come face to face one more time.
2019-05-14, 12:32 a.m. - Sanket: Whole build up as breaker of chains, saviour of people, but a raging targaryen who lost her loved ones was without wise advisors,  
It was hard to see but realistic
2019-05-14, 12:32 a.m. - +91 84859 18837: Although it's better that the love of her from 1s1ep  which makes all here in  season ep8 came for her in the last time..
2019-05-14, 12:33 a.m. - +91 84859 18837: Lill harsh reality,,
2019-05-14, 12:33 a.m. - Sanket: Well, i was so satisfied though seeing her die crying in her last moments
2019-05-14, 12:33 a.m. - Sanket: The old got like feeling,
Won't always please you,
2019-05-14, 12:34 a.m. - +91 84859 18837: Hard to say but, somewhere writers have to much of pressure to make it epic and in tht they're making it disappointing somewhere..
2019-05-14, 12:35 a.m. - +91 84859 18837: I was thinking Danny came to her first and burn her live 1st.. Then go for town..
2019-05-14, 12:35 a.m. - Sanket: More than them, the whiny people crying on internet this season are trying to make it look bad!
2019-05-14, 12:36 a.m. - +91 84859 18837: Now arya's killing Danny is in the somewhere in all of us mind
2019-05-14, 12:36 a.m. - +91 84859 18837: U can't say they're wrong
2019-05-14, 12:37 a.m. - Sanket: She didn't have to go for the town at all, but she did it finally,
But way back in season 2, dany's vision wasn't just random,
It's an awesome interconnectedness man, let's not ruin it for ourselves
2019-05-14, 12:38 a.m. - +91 84859 18837: Like in 3rd episode it's unusual that there was no fight between nk & jon which is Ok,,  bcoz we saw unexceptionable things in got..  But in this episode I've been predicting some things easily,, which never happens before in the GOT..
2019-05-14, 12:39 a.m. - Sanket: Just because some crazy fan theories don't come true and things don't pan out the way they want, 
Yes i can
2019-05-14, 12:39 a.m. - +91 84859 18837: No no..  Not ruined for me.. But it's ruined in some way for show..  Coz she's one of the best character ever.. So u can't give her this type of ending..
2019-05-14, 12:40 a.m. - Sanket: Again,
That vision wasn't supposed to be random
2019-05-14, 12:42 a.m. - +91 84859 18837: 🤷🏻‍♂ okay😅
2019-05-14, 12:42 a.m. - +91 84859 18837: 🤘🏻
2019-05-14, 12:43 a.m. - Sanket: It was very hard to see her doing all that, well after the bell rang, 
Hopefully they have a satisfying end to the series 😐
2019-05-14, 12:43 a.m. - +91 84859 18837: Yea
2019-05-14, 12:43 a.m. - Sanket: <Media omitted>
2019-05-14, 12:45 a.m. - +91 84859 18837: If Danny goes after cersi to kill her only that would be more then ok for me.. Bcoz she have've quite strong villain, even she deserves that type of ending that she dies fearlessly with facing her Oponant..

2019-05-16, 2:49 a.m. - Sanket: Hated what they did to robb and kat,
2019-05-16, 2:49 a.m. - Sanket: That's irrelevant
2019-05-16, 2:50 a.m. - Sanket: I don't have to defend GOT, criticism should be constrictive, what people (including u) are doing is whining

2019-05-16, 2:52 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: Criticism is criticism.
Constructive criticism is applicable when they can do something better in the future.

Worst writers, there is nothing to appreciate at all,
2019-05-16, 3:01 a.m. - Sanket: U should have stopped watching after 3rd episode,  
🤔
Lots of people should have actually if they hate it that much,
2019-05-16, 3:06 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: Why would I stop watching it?
2019-05-16, 3:06 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: That doesn't make sense
2019-05-16, 3:06 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: I'm clinging to the last bit of hope.
2019-05-16, 3:08 a.m. - Sanket: That does actually, 
When i m watching a cricket match, if i lose interest in between, i stop watching it
2019-05-16, 3:09 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: Did you really just compare game of thrones with cricket matches
2019-05-16, 3:10 a.m. - Sanket: No

2019-05-16, 3:28 a.m. - Sanket: Yeh, must be harder than shooting 55 nights in -10°C 
😂
2019-05-16, 3:29 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: Exactly. Shooting 55 nights in a row and then having this bad of a show.

2019-05-16, 12:11 p.m. - Akshay Shah: I have a one question about the end game. When captain and iron Man collect stones from the past, it was in the form of tesseract and scripture. But when captain went to past, it was in the form of stone. And it also include the power stone which can only be hold by some celestial type of people. So, how much the stones without their container affect the other timeline?
2019-05-16, 12:12 p.m. - Sanket: This guy is good

2019-05-16, 12:14 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: I read somewhere or heard that. Hulk helps with that.
2019-05-16, 12:15 p.m. - Sanket: Maybe,
If Stark industry is advanced enough to make a gauntlet which could uphold power of six stones, they could also build some container for that

And now he's back with wildlings, he always had special connection with them and now he's back with ghost,
So a decent ending for jon

2019-05-22, 9:14 a.m. - Sanket: Why not
2019-05-22, 9:14 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: he can control anyone.
2019-05-22, 9:14 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: needs to be open enough
2019-05-22, 9:14 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: i guess he can control humans too. but it's just hard
2019-05-22, 9:14 a.m. - Sanket: He should do it on Drogon to keep the 6 kingdoms safe
2019-05-22, 9:14 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: like with hodor

2019-05-22, 9:21 a.m. - Sanket: Valyrian steel made the NK
2019-05-22, 9:21 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: through dragon glass in his chest

2019-05-22, 9:27 a.m. - Sanket: No targaryens virtually left ,
So how would even they be hatched
2019-05-22, 9:27 a.m. - +91 90991 60199: Jon is alive
2019-05-22, 9:28 a.m. - Sanket: I read somewhere, dragons can change sex,

2019-05-22, 9:28 a.m. - Sanket: Well that's not gonna happen,

2019-05-22, 9:34 a.m. - Sanket: If we assume long lasting peace in westeros with the people they put in charge with bran the broken the leader, credit should go to jon and dany, they might not have a glorious ending, but they played the biggest part in series, i guess
2019-05-22, 9:34 a.m. - Sanket: Dead was defeated because of them

2019-05-25, 11:42 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: That's what I'm asking. I built the tool what do I use it for?
2019-05-25, 11:45 a.m. - Sanket: U could use it to figure out the common interests of those two people, 
But it's straightforward 🤔
2019-05-25, 11:47 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: How would that be straightforward?
2019-05-25, 11:47 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: By default you could do it between you and someone else.
2019-05-25, 11:47 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: Not between someone else and other someone else.
2019-05-25, 11:51 a.m. - Akshay Shah: Yes. But in a large scale.

2019-05-25, 12:47 p.m. - Sanket: Maybe it could work as akinator, two unknown persons, u could guess that person by knowing common following and followers  , if enough clues
2019-05-25, 12:47 p.m. - Sanket: It's so abstract i know,
2019-05-25, 12:47 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: Hmm🤔 🤔 🤔
2019-05-25, 12:47 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: That actually makes sense.
2019-05-25, 12:48 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: But here the interests are usually given in the form of meme pages and all that.
2019-05-25, 12:52 p.m. - Sanket: 😅that's tough then
2019-05-25, 12:53 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: Very.
2019-05-25, 12:53 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: For now it's good at finding out what pages two people follow.🤣
2019-05-25, 12:53 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: Which in my opinion is pretty fucking useless
2019-05-25, 12:54 p.m. - Sanket: 😂

2019-05-25, 2:04 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: I wanna make a network, like a graph.  Given two people at random, how would they be connected on Instagram.
For the sake of argument we are assuming public profiles.
2019-05-25, 2:06 p.m. - +91 84859 18837: Okay..
2019-05-25, 2:07 p.m. - +91 84859 18837: So u're trying to run a script Or what?
2019-05-25, 2:08 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: Yes a python script.
2019-05-25, 2:08 p.m. - +91 84859 18837: They're showing all the matchings mainly by liking sharing ( dm here)  and also of course whom u're following..
2019-05-25, 2:08 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: But it's too much data to go through
2019-05-25, 2:08 p.m. - +91 84859 18837: Obviously..
2019-05-25, 2:08 p.m. - +91 84859 18837: Have u ever go through the posts you've liked section🤔
2019-05-25, 2:09 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: Yeah. Bcoz between let's say you and me we tryna find common chain
2019-05-25, 2:09 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: It would be 2 or 3
2019-05-25, 2:09 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: Me>Harsh Chotaliya>you
2019-05-25, 2:09 p.m. - +91 84859 18837: Okay
2019-05-25, 2:09 p.m. - +91 84859 18837: 🤔
2019-05-25, 2:09 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: But to find that script will have to check Followers of my followers
2019-05-25, 2:10 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: Which is like 400 and then their 400 on average
2019-05-25, 2:10 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: 160000 checks to make.
2019-05-25, 2:10 p.m. - +91 84859 18837: Yea, and they won't allow if they're private
2019-05-25, 2:10 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: I can go till 2 chain.
I can see the following of the people I follow. More than that is on chance.
2019-05-25, 2:11 p.m. - Sanket: Thank u for the high honor 🤑🙇
2019-05-25, 2:11 p.m. - +91 84859 18837: 🙌🏻 yea,,  so that u've to check through all of them
2019-05-25, 2:11 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: Obviously the number wouldn't be this high.
2019-05-25, 2:11 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: There would be many many overlaps
2019-05-25, 2:12 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: But script won't know that. It will check literally everyone.
2019-05-25, 2:12 p.m. - +91 84859 18837: Nd for that u first have to reduce it by just making it to the private account followings
2019-05-25, 2:12 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: Aye.
2019-05-25, 2:12 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: That's not very effective
2019-05-25, 2:12 p.m. - +91 84859 18837: Yea that's why u've to filter it out
2019-05-25, 2:13 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: And finding the shortest path between two people is a whole new problem.
2019-05-25, 2:13 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: Coz Aman>harsh Chotaliya>Vats is a path
2019-05-25, 2:13 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: And
2019-05-25, 2:13 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: Aman>harsh>sanket>some guy>vats
2019-05-25, 2:13 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: Is a path too
2019-05-25, 2:13 p.m. - +91 84859 18837: Like if u're applying it on harsh's profile u've to go for only private account coz, mostly public accounts are pages now days..  So the no. Would be reduces firsr
2019-05-25, 2:14 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: Hm🤔
2019-05-25, 2:14 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: Well instead of finding following. I can go for friends.
2019-05-25, 2:14 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: Following and followers common.
2019-05-25, 2:14 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: The list will be small
2019-05-25, 2:15 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: But still substantially big.
2019-05-25, 2:15 p.m. - +91 84859 18837: Of course.. 😅
2019-05-25, 2:15 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: Makes my head hurt. Thinking about this.
2019-05-25, 2:16 p.m. - +91 84859 18837: Let me think for some time..
2019-05-25, 2:16 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: Sure.
2019-05-25, 2:16 p.m. - +91 84859 18837: It's  easy I think, quite Interesting till we won't find proper solution
2019-05-25, 2:16 p.m. - +91 84859 18837: 😅
2019-05-25, 2:17 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: Btw, the librariy I'm using is instaloader

2019-05-25, 2:17 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: And Python 3
2019-05-25, 2:17 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: If you ever wanna give it a try.
2019-05-25, 2:19 p.m. - +91 84859 18837: Yea
2019-05-25, 2:19 p.m. - +91 84859 18837: M not that into any type of coding even nearer..
2019-05-25, 2:19 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: Do let me know, I'll give you out the basic stuff first to give you a heads-up.
2019-05-25, 2:19 p.m. - +91 84859 18837: But still try maybe
2019-05-25, 2:20 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: No issues. I had no idea about Python
2019-05-25, 2:20 p.m. - +91 84859 18837: Sure..  Bt not for another week
2019-05-25, 2:20 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: I learnt basic stuff for this only. It's pretty easy. You'll get the hang of it.
2019-05-25, 2:20 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: Whenever.
2019-05-25, 2:20 p.m. - +91 84859 18837: Yea..  Actually m more interested in designing side,..  Bit of a designer already😅

2019-05-25, 2:21 p.m. - +91 84859 18837: Yea..  Python is quite easy then any other
2019-05-25, 2:21 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: Design the GUI for this script then when it's done🤣
2019-05-25, 2:21 p.m. - +91 84859 18837: U kw wht, me leaving coding is coz of all small signs mistakes in C & java..
2019-05-25, 2:22 p.m. - +91 84859 18837: Bt python brings my interest back like do write logic only..  Nothing else needed🤣
2019-05-25, 2:22 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: Yeah, I learnt python basics and then went back to Java to write a JavaScript. Forgot to initialize variables and signs and what not.🤣
2019-05-25, 2:22 p.m. - +91 84859 18837: GUI.. 😖 hate it.. 
Video editing.. 😍 love it..

2019-05-26, 8:27 a.m. - +91 90991 60199: Chemistry is study of bonds at atom level.
And pure physics is study of different  forces at molecular level And molecular also.

2019-05-26, 8:31 a.m. - +91 90991 60199: And that's call quantum physics
2019-05-26, 8:32 a.m. - +91 72840 13563: No😀

2019-05-26, 8:39 a.m. - Sanket: Quantum physics actually works everywhere,
It's just similar to classical physics at macro level,
2019-05-26, 8:40 a.m. - +91 90991 60199: That is correct.

2019-06-08, 10:09 a.m. - +91 82382 78192: And also how will world react when the original captian comes out of ice in 2011 while the captain travelled back in time is still alive...!?
2019-06-08, 10:16 a.m. - Sanket: Dude, if going in past is possible, there must be infinite realities,
So when the cap of the reality we know (frozen in ice guy) went back in 1940s, realities got spiltted, now there is an alternate reality where cap is not the one we know , and he ages normally and gets old,

2019-06-08, 10:25 a.m. - Sanket: So from the time when cap fell off and got frozen in ice, two realities got splitted, 

One- cap who is frozen, and after 70 yrs he is rescued etc etc 

Two- tesseract as well should have a different fate in cap's first movie, and those nuclear missiles as well, and somehow he doesn't have to die protecting others and comes back to his date with peggy and he gets old,
2019-06-08, 10:28 a.m. - +91 82382 78192: Then where did the captian went after endgame
2019-06-08, 10:28 a.m. - Akshay Shah: no bro cap is in same timeline.  And Two tesseract is never possible because as ancient one explain balance is necessary to control the flow of universe
2019-06-08, 10:29 a.m. - Akshay Shah: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5-8ZHgcIgk
2019-06-08, 10:29 a.m. - +91 82382 78192: Point!!!!
2019-06-08, 10:29 a.m. - Sanket: There  are no two tesseracts,
It has different fate in different realities,
2019-06-08, 10:31 a.m. - Sanket: After he resurrected all stones, he went back in time and created an alternate reality,
2019-06-08, 10:31 a.m. - Sanket: Bro u don't understand time travel,
If u go back in time, u can't change the future, u create an alternate reality
2019-06-08, 10:32 a.m. - Akshay Shah: If this happens then how he returns to the main universes?
2019-06-08, 10:32 a.m. - +91 82382 78192: Just tell me this as captian has went back right in time right.... He probably went to time from where he ans stark stole tesseract and then he settled there... In 1970
2019-06-08, 10:33 a.m. - Akshay Shah: that's why cap never alter the timeline. remember Peggy's mysterious husband scene.
2019-06-08, 10:33 a.m. - +91 82382 78192: Then how did he returned to main timeline in the end
2019-06-08, 10:33 a.m. - Sanket: 🤦🏻‍♂
2019-06-08, 10:33 a.m. - +91 82382 78192: Coz u can't shift between time lines
2019-06-08, 10:34 a.m. - Sanket: U should have also asked then, that if thanos of 2014 dies in 2023 then how did the infinity war happen
2019-06-08, 10:34 a.m. - Akshay Shah: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qs821jaO51Q    see after 4:36
2019-06-08, 10:34 a.m. - +91 82382 78192: And if u alter anyone event in the history there will be new timelind walking side to side like a mirage
2019-06-08, 10:34 a.m. - +91 82382 78192: That's goes to other time line
2019-06-08, 10:35 a.m. - +91 82382 78192: Simple
2019-06-08, 10:41 a.m. - +91 82382 78192: Whoa.... Video is 🙏🏻

2019-06-08, 12:39 p.m. - Sanket: ..... If it is the same timeline, then what about all the things old-young cap did in present MCU?
2019-06-08, 12:47 p.m. - Sanket: @919409654949 ??
2019-06-08, 1:38 p.m. - Akshay Shah: It remains the same and captain who lives with Peggy doesn't do anything unusual that it creates the alternate timeline. That means, he knew about Hydra, winter soldier, death of haward stark but still he didn't do anything.  There is also chance that he was turned into the dust during infinity war.  But there is no different timeline creats by Captain because he return on same place.

2019-08-24, 8:02 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: So basically it's like um a program, which takes in data(for training).
Imagine a child of age 2. It sees some data for the first time and then is forced to look at that data over and over again. Eventually it starts to figure out patterns on its own and then when asked a question, in this case, "what do you think an email looks like?" It tries it's best and writes it for you.

2019-08-24, 8:02 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: Completely random, believable, never been seen before emails.
2019-08-24, 8:03 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: I hope that kinda makes sense.😅
2019-08-24, 8:04 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: <Media omitted>
2019-08-24, 8:04 a.m. - +91 72840 13563: Wow cool how much data you had to put in for the training? I mean is there a range in which it starts recognizing patterns?
2019-08-24, 8:05 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: <Media omitted>
2019-08-24, 8:05 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: For emails it's like 6000-7000 lines of emails.
2019-08-24, 8:05 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: Trained it thrice on the same data. It picks up something different everytime
2019-08-24, 8:05 a.m. - +91 72840 13563: Its kinda similar to alpha go right the machine which is unbeatable in chess?
2019-08-24, 8:06 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: The Sherlock database was about 80k lines long. Had to keep it running overnight. Only one time trained.
2019-08-24, 8:06 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: And the Taylor Swift lines were around 5k. Trained 3 times.
2019-08-24, 8:06 a.m. - +91 72840 13563: Wow its like Sansa stark slow learner but learns😂
2019-08-24, 8:06 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: The words are gibberish but by a quick glance you can get the feel ke it's a song or a novel or something
2019-08-24, 8:07 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: I'm planning to make the bot watch game of thrones ki script
2019-08-24, 8:07 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: And then make it write a new final episode
2019-08-24, 8:07 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: 😂
2019-08-24, 8:07 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: Yes. It eventually learns.
2019-08-24, 8:07 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: Yes. It was a different model but concept was like almost same.
2019-08-24, 8:08 a.m. - +91 72840 13563: Why don't you try poetry in which there are more rhyming word?
2019-08-24, 8:08 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: Fuck. That's a really good idea.
2019-08-24, 8:08 a.m. - +91 72840 13563: You may get a better result
2019-08-24, 8:08 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: I've been asking people for what next to make bot rrad.
2019-08-24, 8:08 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: Read
2019-08-24, 8:09 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: No one came up with that.
2019-08-24, 8:09 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: Yeah, bot will eventually pick up on rhymes
2019-08-24, 8:18 a.m. - +91 72840 13563: You can also try rap songs😅
2019-08-24, 8:20 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: 🤔

2019-09-03, 10:30 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: So in the all the future where the rat doesn't trip the switches, he can just stop watching it. As nothing is going to happen.
2019-09-03, 10:31 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: Not all future events' length is going to equal. Some take longer on average and some take shorter time.
2019-09-03, 10:31 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: This is pretty good approximate though. Salute for that
2019-09-03, 10:31 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: Doesn't matter. It's all in time travel
2019-09-03, 10:32 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: Like how he died with dormamu
2019-09-03, 10:32 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: It could be millions and millions of times.
2019-09-03, 10:32 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: He may be the only person after the Gods in MCU to live that long and have all that experience.
2019-09-03, 10:32 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: He literally has more experience of being alive and dying.
2019-09-03, 10:33 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: More than even Thor
2019-09-03, 10:33 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: And Thor is 1500 years old
2019-09-03, 10:33 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: Or even ego the living planet
2019-09-03, 10:33 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: Dr Strange has died so many times and has seen so much stuff he is damn near impossible to beat.

2019-09-05, 10:15 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: Plus he should still have detention videos
2019-09-05, 10:34 a.m. - Akshay Shah: Cap will take patience and moral lectures for punishment.
2019-09-05, 10:35 a.m. - Akshay Shah: And iron man will only take  special classes like expert talk.

2019-09-06, 10:00 p.m. - Sanket: Man... Isro loses contact with chandrayan 2,
2019-09-06, 10:01 p.m. - +91 82382 78192: Hey guys
2019-09-06, 10:01 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: Yeah
2019-09-06, 10:02 p.m. - +91 82382 78192: Isn't it possible to identify the location by projecting gamma or any other types of rays
2019-09-06, 10:02 p.m. - +91 82382 78192: Coz the rover was only about 2.1 km from moons surface
2019-09-06, 10:02 p.m. - Sanket: Hope they recover as soon as possible
2019-09-06, 10:02 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: Projecting ways at what?!
2019-09-06, 10:02 p.m. - +91 82382 78192: And we have contact with vikram  lander but not with the rover
2019-09-06, 10:03 p.m. - +91 82382 78192: On the moon
2019-09-06, 10:03 p.m. - Sanket: U need to elaborate
2019-09-06, 10:03 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: If you are referring to using a sonar like device
2019-09-06, 10:03 p.m. - +91 82382 78192: Yup
2019-09-06, 10:03 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: It is not possible.
2019-09-06, 10:03 p.m. - +91 82382 78192: Rays will stike and comeback
2019-09-06, 10:03 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: Those rays need to come back
2019-09-06, 10:03 p.m. - +91 82382 78192: Not sonar as it uses longitudinal waves
2019-09-06, 10:03 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: Why would they come back?
2019-09-06, 10:04 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: Sonar like,dude.😑
2019-09-06, 10:04 p.m. - +91 82382 78192: Reflection
2019-09-06, 10:04 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: Sonar doesn't work in space.
2019-09-06, 10:04 p.m. - +91 82382 78192: More of electromagnetic waves
2019-09-06, 10:04 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: Why would they reflect back to you?
2019-09-06, 10:04 p.m. - Sanket: 😂
2019-09-06, 10:05 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: Only the rays you send down perpendicular will come back
2019-09-06, 10:05 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: If you send the rays at an angle from let's say the lunar orbiter
2019-09-06, 10:05 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: The ways will go of somewhere else.
2019-09-06, 10:05 p.m. - +91 82382 78192: Look the surface of the rover will of gold or other metal they will absorb the rays... Then once the capacity ends it will probably release it out
2019-09-06, 10:05 p.m. - +91 82382 78192: Whts bad in doing
2019-09-06, 10:06 p.m. - +91 82382 78192: What loss do we get?
2019-09-06, 10:06 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: But the type of radar you are suggesting doesn't work.
2019-09-06, 10:06 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: It's obvious man.
2019-09-06, 10:06 p.m. - +91 82382 78192: Nope in the 200 or 500 sq km area where the rover has been lost
2019-09-06, 10:06 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: 🤦🏻‍♂ arey
2019-09-06, 10:06 p.m. - +91 82382 78192: It's lost 2.1km from surface
2019-09-06, 10:07 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: This idea of making this rader thing would work if you had the entire moon covered in orbiters
2019-09-06, 10:07 p.m. - +91 82382 78192: Calculate 500 km in all the possible directions
2019-09-06, 10:07 p.m. - Sanket: So u think u can just send a light beam like 'swishh' at moon and it will just strike there and will reflect back and will tell u where the rover is?!
2019-09-06, 10:07 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: But with what?!
2019-09-06, 10:07 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: You send a light beam yes, got it.
2019-09-06, 10:08 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: But why would the light beam come back to you? At the exact same spot?
2019-09-06, 10:08 p.m. - +91 82382 78192: Yup
2019-09-06, 10:08 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: Wouldn't it reflect away from you?!
2019-09-06, 10:08 p.m. - Sanket: Wow
2019-09-06, 10:08 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: But the light beam doesn't come back!
2019-09-06, 10:08 p.m. - +91 82382 78192: If u project it that way
2019-09-06, 10:08 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: Why would it?
2019-09-06, 10:08 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: Vishwas
2019-09-06, 10:09 p.m. - +91 82382 78192: Yup
2019-09-06, 10:09 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: No matter how you shine a laser or a flashlight
2019-09-06, 10:09 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: It's going to reflect away from you.
2019-09-06, 10:09 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: Unless you shine it down, perpendicularity
2019-09-06, 10:09 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: Perpendicularly*
2019-09-06, 10:09 p.m. - +91 82382 78192: How about a telescope 🔭
2019-09-06, 10:09 p.m. - +91 82382 78192: Thts I'm talking about
2019-09-06, 10:11 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: <Media omitted>
2019-09-06, 10:11 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: That's just one light Ray or whatever rsy
2019-09-06, 10:11 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: And I'm pretty sure gamma wouldn't work.
2019-09-06, 10:12 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: You need something of the larger wavelength
2019-09-06, 10:12 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: Radiowaves and gamma waves are at the opposite point of each other.
2019-09-06, 10:12 p.m. - +91 82382 78192: What of there was something radioactive substance in rover
2019-09-06, 10:13 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: Which was it?
2019-09-06, 10:13 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: Unless it was something with a very very low half-life. Forget radiology on it.
2019-09-06, 10:13 p.m. - +91 82382 78192: Radioactive substance radiate rays in all the direction
2019-09-06, 10:13 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: Detect it with what?
2019-09-06, 10:13 p.m. - +91 82382 78192: Vikram
2019-09-06, 10:14 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: You want them to pin point the location with a geiger counter?
2019-09-06, 10:14 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: With what tool, I'm asking.
2019-09-06, 10:14 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: This magnificent "radiation detector"that you are talking about wouldn't work
2019-09-06, 10:15 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: It wouldn't point to the lost rover
2019-09-06, 10:15 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: It would probably point to sun, due to solar wind.
2019-09-06, 10:16 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: You are forgetting, that moon has no atmosphere or no strong magnetic fields to shield from solar winds. which makes the entire Chernobyl disaster look like a garden in terms of radiation compared to the moon.
2019-09-06, 10:16 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: Next idea.
2019-09-06, 10:16 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: 😬
2019-09-06, 10:17 p.m. - +91 82382 78192: Well I'll call u in this
2019-09-06, 10:17 p.m. - +91 82382 78192: Too much stuff to type
2019-09-06, 10:17 p.m. - +91 82382 78192: I'll get back to u
2019-09-06, 10:17 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: But you did understood this right?
2019-09-06, 10:18 p.m. - +91 82382 78192: Now I'm reading so see u soon
2019-09-06, 10:18 p.m. - +91 82382 78192: Let's see
2019-09-06, 10:18 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: Understand*
2019-09-06, 10:18 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: Let me just make one thing clear.
2019-09-06, 10:18 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: The way, avengers pin pointed the location of the snaps by finding out the gamma radiation.
2019-09-06, 10:19 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: Yeah, that doesn't happen in real world. You want to pin point, you need atleast 3 detectors in an perfectly ideal situation to triangulate a position m
2019-09-06, 10:20 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: That's why your phone isn't just connected to 3 satellites, but atleast 12-13 as redundancies.
2019-09-06, 10:39 p.m. - Akshay Shah: Can we use some other satellite? I mean other country satellite to identify the condition of the rover.
2019-09-06, 11:05 p.m. - Sanket: If anything else can be done, they know it better
2019-09-07, 12:52 a.m. - +91 97377 29007: Yeah
2019-09-07, 5:49 a.m. - +91 82382 78192: Upcoming ISRO Projects
1. 2019-20 Aditya L1: Mission to study sun's corona and it's atmosphere

2. Dec 2021-Jan2022 Gaganyaan Mission : Attempt to send humans in space.

3. 2022-2023 Mangalyaan 2: Mangalyaan-2 orbiter will use aerobraking to lower its initial apoapsis and enter into an orbit more suitable for observations

4. Late 2020s Chandryaan 3: It could be the attempt to send Indian robot on moon(maybe the dark side)

5 2023-2025 Shukrayaan Mission : Mission to venus
2019-09-07, 5:49 a.m. - +91 82382 78192: Anyone excited?

2019-10-24, 12:24 p.m. - +91 82382 78192: Is sun white???
2019-10-24, 12:29 p.m. - +91 82382 78192: Well if its white the pics of sun taken from space shall show sun as a white spot... But its all orange... Coz no atmosphere in space to diffract the photon so to show sun orange
2019-10-24, 12:30 p.m. - Sanket: What????
2019-10-24, 12:31 p.m. - Rohan: 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
2019-10-24, 12:31 p.m. - Rohan: I can feel this 😂😂
2019-10-24, 12:31 p.m. - Sanket: 🤣
2019-10-24, 12:38 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: Depends upon the temperature
2019-10-24, 12:38 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: Of any star
2019-10-24, 12:38 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: It's spectrum.
2019-10-24, 12:43 p.m. - +91 97377 29007: Sanket here is our local physicist
2019-10-24, 1:11 p.m. - Sanket: No offence but, It was asked in pretty abstract manner, difficult for even an established physicist to answer 
😅😂
2019-10-24, 1:15 p.m. - +91 82382 78192: 🙄
2019-10-24, 1:16 p.m. - +91 72840 13563: This is common misconception!Technically colors don't exist the matter which absorb the E.M radiation emits the radiation of certain kind of wavelength which is called spectrum. In case of sun it emits the radiation of all the wavelengths so it depends....
2019-10-24, 1:18 p.m. - +91 72840 13563: Just like different cameras will depict different kinda of colors of an object for example watching something through infrared cameras
2019-10-24, 1:21 p.m. - +91 72840 13563: BTW even our brains responds to colours in a weird ways you should see some videos on YouTube if interested😅
2019-10-24, 1:43 p.m. - +91 82382 78192: If 100 people see sun in space at same time almost all will see different on basis of wavelength there eyes capture
2019-10-24, 1:44 p.m. - +91 82382 78192: Coz sun release diffrent wavelength at Sametime
2019-10-24, 1:47 p.m. - +91 82382 78192: 🤣
2019-10-24, 1:54 p.m. - +91 72840 13563: People can't look at the sun😅 and even if they do somehow then no because mostly all of the humans  eyes maybe sees the objects same because they all absorb same colours i don't know biology so possibly...but yeah some animals see objects differently then others

2019-10-24, 1:55 p.m. - +91 72840 13563: We can not trust our senses see this great debate
2019-10-24, 2:20 p.m. - Sanket: I read it 5-6-7 times, so here what i deduce from it,

No sun is not white, light(visible spectra) that sun emits is white, combination of all 7 colors of visible spectra, Sun seems yellow, that is only because its short-wavelength colors (green, blue, violet) are scattered out by the Earth's atmosphere, much like small waves are dispersed by big rocks along the shore, Hence only the reds, yellows, and oranges get through the thick atmosphere to our eyes..
2019-10-24, 2:26 p.m. - Sanket: Another thing is,  
Colors of stars depend on their temperature and age.. 
Sun is in it's middle age and has approximate 6000K surface temp, that is characteristic of a "yellow" colored star...

Give me the job and I will show you how good I am.
